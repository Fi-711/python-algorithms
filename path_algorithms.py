# Dijkstra's Algorithm - see graphs for implementation
# Provided that all of the vertices are reachable from the source vertex;
# Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm can be used to find the shortest distance from the
# source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The graph can be
# directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic, but the weights on all edges
# need to be non-negative.
