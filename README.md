### TOP FIVE ALGORITHMS ACCORDING TO RISC (Research Institute for Symbolic Computing)
A* search algorithm
Graph search algorithm that finds a path from a given initial node to a 
given goal node. It employs a heuristic estimate that ranks each node by 
an estimate of the best route that goes through that node. It visits the 
nodes in order of this heuristic estimate. The A* algorithm is therefore 
an example of best-first search.
